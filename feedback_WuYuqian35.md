1. I added some new content in my Week 4 practical file. I added some content in thingsIlike.txt.
2. In week 5 practical, I added the answer in mystery_code.py. The original answer I wrote was not complete. So I added more texts to complete the answer.
3. In week 5 practical, r_rate.py, my code got the wrong answer at the first time because I didn't fully understand the problem at the first time. I change the original 'n=n*r' in line 4 into 'n=n*r+n' to calculate the total number of people infected. This time I got the right answer.
4. In week 6 practical, coronavirus_infection0.py, my code couldn't show the title of the pie chart at the first time. I added the code 'plt.title('Coronavirus rates')' at line 23 to show the name of the chart.
